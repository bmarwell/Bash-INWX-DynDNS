= INWX DynDNS Script

This is a small bash script, which works as a DynDNS updater. It works only with domains which are registered at https://inwx.de[inwx.de]. It only updates the ip record, if the ip has changed.

== Requirements

This script does not require any additional tools. All tools should be available on a regular linux system:

* curl
* sed

== Installation

. Create a new directory in your home folder. E.g. dyndns.

----
mkdir ~/dyndns
cd ~/dyndns

----

. 

Clone the files from github

----
git clone git@github.com:gehaxelt/Bash-INWX-DynDNS.git .
----

. Edit the dnsupdate.sh and fill in your login credentials.

. Get the wished dns entry ID from the inwx website and set it in the script. See below how to get the ID.<br />
When you not have an ID (like IPv6) than use `DNSIDsv6=()`, an empty array. When you have one ID (like 7654321), use `DNSIDsv6=(&quot;7654321&quot;)` and if you have multiple IDs use `DNSIDsv6=(&quot;7654321&quot; &quot;8901234&quot;)`, same usage for IPv4.

. If desired, enter at `UPDATEURLv4=&quot;&quot;` the URL from which the IPv4 address should be retrieved, same for IPv6.
. Edit your crontab. For a 5-minutes update use: `*/5 * * * * cd /home/$USER/dyndns &amp;&amp; bash dnsupdate.sh`

== How to obtain the DNS entry ID?

First, login to the https://inwx.de[inwx] website. Navigate to "Nameserver" section:

Then open the DNS entries for your domain and right-click on the entry you'd like to dynamically update. Choose the "inspect element" menue entry.

Now you should see the developer tools and a `&lt;div&gt;`-element. The number in the `id`-attribute's value after `record_div_` is the wanted number.

Copy this ID (here: 206895961) into your script.

Alternatively you can use the https://www.inwx.de/de/help/apidoc/f/ch02s09.html#nameserver.info[INWX API] to obtain the record id.
